# Cisco-Inventory-Management

The objective was to predict product demand and plan inventory levels for
the next quarter to avoid delays in order fulfillment.
* Trained different time series models like Holt-Winters, SARIMAX, Exponential Smoothing,
Prophet separately for each product.
* Stacked the results obtained by each model to build a robust predictive model which reduced the SMAPE score by 23% from individual models.
* Developed and deployed a website where the user can use individual Product ID and month for forecasting predictions up to next year.
